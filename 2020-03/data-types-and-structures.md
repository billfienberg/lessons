# Data Types and Data Structures

## Intro

### Ask permission to record

### Background

- I went to college for business, started learning on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/), used Excel at an internship, and then went to a coding bootcamp. 

### Myths

- You have to start when you're young
  - Rebuttal: I didn't start learning my first programming language until I was 25.
- You have to be really smart
  - Rebuttal: I'm not allowed to use the oven, and I took this [picture in October 2019](https://photos.app.goo.gl/33DJ81t5S7TUixgA8).
- You have to be good at math
  - Rebuttal: I struggled with everything after basic algebra. 

## Environment

- Browser console:
  1.  Type about:blank in your URL bar, and hit enter
  1. Open your browser’s dev tools (https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)
- REPL: https://repljs.com/new

## JavaScript Variables

### `var`

Examples: 
```
var name = “Bill”
var age = 32
var isHuman = true
var isDog = false
var jibberish = ‘sdfgvhbjn’
```

### `let`

Examples: 
```
let name = “Bill”
let age = 32
let isHuman = true
let isDog = false
let sdfgvhbjn’ = ‘jibberish’
```

### `const`

Examples: 
```
const name = “Bill”
const age = 32
const isHuman = true
const isDog = false
const jibberish = ‘sdfghj’
```

## JavaScript Primitives

### Number

Examples
```
const age = 32
const numberOfDogs = 1
const zero = 0
const negative = -1
const float = 78.6
```

### String

Examples: 
```
const name = “Bill”
const city = ‘Austin’
const dog = ‘Zoe’
```

### Boolean

Examples: 
```
const isHuman = true
const isDog = false
```

### Undefined

Examples: 
```
const myRetirementYear = undefined
const quarantineEndDate = undefined
```

### Null

```
const mikeBloombergsCompassion = null
const outerSpace = null
```

## JavaScript Data Structures

### Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object depending upon the language). Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store only one value. 
Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various methods.

### Objects AKA hash AKA dictionary

Kay-value pairs
